# PMSM Control Claude Skills (for MATLAB / Simulink)

A methodology and skill library for AI-augmented MATLAB/Simulink modeling of
**Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)** control, built for use with
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

The repository is itself a Claude Code workspace: clone it, install the
prerequisites, open Claude Code in the folder, and follow [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Workspace entry point — setup steps and working rules a fresh Claude Code reads on open. |
| `.claude/skills/` | Four PMSM modeling skills (Claude Code skill format), registered automatically when Claude Code opens this folder. |
| `workflow/` | The 11-phase [Reference Model Learning Workflow](workflow/reference_model_learning_workflow.md) for distilling a reference model into a Claude Code skill under anti-contamination discipline. |
| `shared/` | Domain assets the skills reuse: `formulas/` (PMSM plant model + control-law derivations), `building_blocks/` (atomic Simulink blocks + API notes). |
| `workspace/` | Where you build your own models. |

## Skills

- **`motor-pmsm-base`** — PMSM plant modeling, dq conventions, building-blocks SOP, broken-FOC diagnostics. The method skills layer on this.
- **`motor-fcs-mpc`** — single-vector Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control (inner current loop).
- **`motor-dtc-pmsm`** — Direct Torque Control (αβ frame, Sutikno 6-state switching table).
- **`motor-smc-pmsm`** — Sliding Mode Control speed loop (PD-type sliding surface + super-twisting) over a dq PI current loop.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2024b or later, with Simulink, Simscape, Simscape Electrical, Control System Toolbox.
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).
- [matlab-mcp-core-server](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-mcp-core-server) (MathWorks, MIT) — lets Claude Code run MATLAB directly. Install per its README.
- MathWorks' official MATLAB skills for Claude Code — install per MathWorks' instructions.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the prerequisites above.
3. Open Claude Code in the repository folder. It loads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and registers `.claude/skills/`.
4. Follow [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and `workflow/`.

## Reproducibility & Evidence

This repository ships **skills (instructions)** and **shared assets** (`formulas/`,
`building_blocks/`). It does **not** include end-to-end build scripts that generate
complete models, simulation results (`.mat`, waveforms, logs), or a CI harness —
those live in the author's private development repository. The only runnable
artifacts here are the `pi_design.m` scripts under `.claude/skills/*/scripts/`.

The case studies in [`workflow/`](workflow/reference_model_learning_workflow.md)
(Appendix C) are **anonymized narrative** descriptions of engineering experience
(problem / diagnosis / resolution), not artifact-backed reproducible benchmarks.
Phrases like "validated case" refer to the author's private testing — treat them as
documented experience, not published, data-backed benchmarks.

To reproduce: install the prerequisites, then drive the skills with your own build
script and your own PMSM parameters.

## Attribution and license compatibility

This repository **indexes** — it does not redistribute — the following MathWorks
open-source references, used by workflow phases that need official ecosystem
reference models. Clone them separately if needed:

`shared/building_blocks/pmsm_blocks.slx` is a **user-authored** Simulink model that
references MathWorks Simscape Electrical library blocks (PMSM, Universal Bridge,
powergui, SVPWM, etc.) **by reference** — it does not embed or redistribute MathWorks
block implementations. Opening it requires your own licensed MATLAB + Simulink +
Simscape Electrical installation, the same way models are shared on MathWorks File
Exchange.
